<p>TL;DR: We had an 18-hour-long overnight stopover in Bejing early April and went to see <em>Mutianyu</em> section of the Great Wall of China. Would do it again. Weather was crazy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back in December of 2018, we&rsquo;ve been planning a trip to Japan and were looking for ways to save on airfare. The cheapest option we discovered was with <em>Air China</em> and included an overnight stopover. Our friends who flew with some other Chinese airlines told us they got free accommodation whenever they had an overnight stopover. We couldn&rsquo;t find such an option on our reservation but even counting the price of 2 nights in Beijing it was still the cheapest alternative. Even if it&rsquo;s just for a couple of hours, we decided to use this as an opportunity to get a sneak peek at Beijing. For what it worth, when we were flying out of Beijing, I installed <em>Air China</em> iOS app and accidentally found a way to request free accommodation for our reservation. It could&rsquo;ve reduced our expenses even further, but I don&rsquo;t know how (if anyhow) it would&rsquo;ve affected immigration check.</p>

<p>As fellow Ukrainians, we were able to leverage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_China">144-hour visa-free transit</a> given that we were traveling through Beijing airport and both inbound and outbound flights were international. The immigration check process is briefly explained on <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Beijing#By_plane">Wikitravel</a>. The only caveat is that if you&rsquo;re booking accommodation on your own and staying for less than 2 nights - prefer a hotel over Airbnb or a guesthouse. All foreign visitors have to be registered with a local police office within 24 hours of arrival. Hotels can do it automatically, but individual hosts are most likely to cancel your reservation at the very last moment.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/010_hud6e8fd4a917341bb10fe17bdc40bf867_2153055_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/010_hud6e8fd4a917341bb10fe17bdc40bf867_2153055_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Hotel Cote Cour Beijing" /></p>

<p>The <em>Great Wall of China</em> on its own is not a single construction but rather a set of independent fortifications. Several sections are located in close vicinity of <em>Beijing</em> and each of them can be visited in a day.</p>

<p>All of them can be reached by public transport but given a very tight schedule we decided to go with a taxi. At this point, the total estimated cost of flight through <em>Beijing</em> started to surpass some of the alternatives, but we were crazy about the idea.</p>

<p>We considered just 3 of the nearby sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Badaling</em> - most popular</li>
<li><em>Juyongguan</em> - closest to the city</li>
<li><em>Mutianyu</em> - closest to the airport</li>
</ul>

<p>and went with the last one as per suggestion from our hotel staff. They recommended it to us as a less crowded one and the one closest to <em>Beijing Capital Airport</em>.</p>

<p>We stayed in <em>Hotel Cote Cour Beijing</em> and loved everything about our experience. They were very responsive via email and helped us to plan our crazy endeavor. Besides that, they stayed up until late waiting for our arrival and provided us with delicious sandwiches instead of the breakfast we were going to miss.  Last but not least, they arranged a guide who would drive us to <em>Mutianyu</em> at 6 o&rsquo;clock the next morning. Reflecting back, I think it would&rsquo;ve been more efficient to stay in one of the hotels just next to <em>Mutianyu</em>. Nevertheless, I loved our experience so much I don&rsquo;t regret we did what we did.</p>

<p>Price-wise, there are plenty of options for private tours available online. We did consider some of them, but none were able to beat the price our hotel offered us. All in all, we paid 1100 CNY (aka RMB) for a driver who brought us from the hotel doors to <em>Mutianyu</em>, waited for us there and then dropped us off at the airport.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/020_hub15828d8338a2a2dcf3df6599e2ac358_6345527_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/020_hub15828d8338a2a2dcf3df6599e2ac358_6345527_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Visitor Center" /></p>

<p>Anticipating the visit we were checking what others were posting on <em>Instagram</em> the previous day and weather seemed to be clear and shiny. Apparently, two of us used up all our luck back in Japan. We woke up to a dim overcast that turned into heavy rain by the time we reached <em>Mutianyu</em>.</p>

<p>The farthest regular private transport can reach at <em>Mutianyu</em> is the parking near the visitor center. You buy your tickets here and proceed to the wall itself, which is about 3 km away. There is a shuttle bus that can bring you there just in 10 minutes. Don&rsquo;t forget to buy a ticket for it together with the admission.</p>

<p>All of that is covered in great detail in <a href="https://www.travelchinaguide.com/china_great_wall/scene/beijing/mutianyu.htm">this article from Travel China Guide</a>.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/021_hue44a79bdcbf9ebf1afa5722463963974_2465072_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/021_hue44a79bdcbf9ebf1afa5722463963974_2465072_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Business Hours - 08:00-17:30" /></p>

<p>The tricky part is timing though. Apparently at <em>Mutianyu</em> there is a concept of &ldquo;low&rdquo; and &ldquo;high&rdquo; seasons - November 16 to March 15 and March 16 to November 15 respectively. As calendar was showing April 9 today, we were hitting the &ldquo;high season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find any trustworthy information about business hours online and were planning based on the shuttle bus timetable we saw at <a href="http://www.wildgreatwall.com/wild-great-wall/mutianyu-great-wall/">WildGreatWall</a>.</p>

<p>We left our hotel in the center of <em>Beijing</em> around 6:10. The road condition was good, and the traffic early Tuesday morning was light. It took us precisely an hour to reach the visitor center parking.</p>

<p>By 7:20, we were inside the visitor center, but it was dark and empty inside there. While waiting for the ticket office to open, we saw a large information screen stating that business hours today are from 08:00 to 17:30.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I can make sense of a setup where the shuttle bus starts running earlier than the ticket office opens. My only assumption is that it&rsquo;s designed to accommodate those who are buying tickets online, but <a href="http://www.mutianyugreatwall.com">the official website</a> never worked for us.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/023_hu2330d247751e21698bb28cfffa0d09d5_2363343_0x1500_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/023_hu2330d247751e21698bb28cfffa0d09d5_2363343_0x800_resize_q75_box.jpg#left" alt="Shuttle Bus" /></p>

<p>While we were preparing for a long wait, our driver quickly chatted with cashiers and they sold us tickets by 7:30.</p>

<p>You reach the shuttle bus stop by walking from the ticket office through a huge block of souvenir shops and food stalls. Although, none of them were open that early.</p>

<p>It took us 10 minutes to find our way and board a shuttle.</p>

<p>Another 10 minutes passed before about a dozen people joined us on the bus, and it departed. Looking at the road we were driving through I&rsquo;d highly discourage anyone walking that path.</p>

<p>We arrived sharp at 8:00 and started walking to the ticket gates.</p>

<p>Normally, one can choose between a cable car, a chair lift and a trail to get onto the wall, but at the time only cable car was open due to bad weather.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/030_hu7cff6e6aebf48d0dd258ecbc84ef505d_3560620_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/030_hu7cff6e6aebf48d0dd258ecbc84ef505d_3560620_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Another side effect of inclement weather was that everything was slippery. The road to the wall is pretty steep, and the pavement blocks felt like they were designed to stop those who are not brave enough.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/031_hudeed0b0556e187cdbdba6bdcd27edca8_5814231_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/031_hudeed0b0556e187cdbdba6bdcd27edca8_5814231_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Slippery Pavement" /></p>

<p>Walking fast, we made it to the cable car station in just 7 minutes.</p>

<p>Four-seater cabins were running one after another, and 1 minute later we were already on our way up.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/032_hu253f2530523f1d06a9a2553b7bfa0c5a_9648243_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/032_hu253f2530523f1d06a9a2553b7bfa0c5a_9648243_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The entire ascent to the upper station took about 4 minutes.</p>

<p>Not that I expected something else, but for the record - the cable car cabin appeared well maintained and clean. Looking at the scenery around, it felt rather like a rainy November than sunny April.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/040_hu322b68102a0114c32314aa9d97113760_3629857_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/040_hu322b68102a0114c32314aa9d97113760_3629857_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>While on the way, our jaws dropped as heavy rain transformed into an intense snowstorm. Cherry trees in their blossom looked gorgeous. It was hard to believe it was clear here just a day before.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/041_hu6d7f379adf2f99e9be6b2266fd61019a_3532370_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/041_hu6d7f379adf2f99e9be6b2266fd61019a_3532370_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably even more stunning here in the winter, but I wonder what it takes to get here when all the roads are snowy. We did drive most of the time on highways, but the closer we were getting to <em>Mutianyu</em> the smaller roads we were taking. I&rsquo;m not sure how quickly they are cleaned, if at all.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/042_hu8c4dd1c522aaf79ea3a6397f6e31add1_1111855_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/042_hu8c4dd1c522aaf79ea3a6397f6e31add1_1111855_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Winter is Coming [Back]" /></p>

<p>By 08:12, we reached the upper station, and from there it&rsquo;s a short 5-minute walk to get onto the actual wall.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/043_huab3ed040026842bd9c6a88113c596e6e_11753220_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/043_huab3ed040026842bd9c6a88113c596e6e_11753220_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because of the weather or just because we were there so early. We literally had the entire place for ourselves.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/050_hu14209175ce5993f0af50b46b4f7ef19d_4316839_0x1500_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/050_hu14209175ce5993f0af50b46b4f7ef19d_4316839_0x800_resize_q75_box.jpg#left" alt="" />
<img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/051_hu7f39d3714f1e9949270c2fb707be5bf3_3319515_0x1500_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/051_hu7f39d3714f1e9949270c2fb707be5bf3_3319515_0x800_resize_q75_box.jpg#right" alt="" /></p>

<p>Cherry trees in full blossom were gorgeous under the fresh layer of snow.</p>

<p>Finally, we&rsquo;re on the wall.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/060_huecbd51315a84b9217f232d1ed8fe2011_6934345_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/060_huecbd51315a84b9217f232d1ed8fe2011_6934345_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We expected large crowds even at such early time and couldn&rsquo;t believe our eyes when it was entirely empty. In other words, you can get a stunning view of the wall without a single human around. Yes, it&rsquo;s possible. You would need to go as early as we did and tolerate lousy weather, but it&rsquo;s totally worth it.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/061_hu30539da1a50d40dde92b81a0b8d62c67_3059138_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/061_hu30539da1a50d40dde92b81a0b8d62c67_3059138_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I would come back again to see the wall on a clear day with all the greenery around, fly a drone around and ride toboggan to come down from the wall. That would&rsquo;ve been a visit as I would expect it. But the view we got beat all the expectations I ever had about visiting the <em>Great Wall of China</em>.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/062_hu3223369be99da02350c54b1ef49fece2_4910035_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/062_hu3223369be99da02350c54b1ef49fece2_4910035_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Between the moment we left the hotel and the moment we took the first shot atop the wall passed roughly 2 hours. We were lucky to avoid all the traffic and don&rsquo;t wait in any single line. From what we read online, it appears that our experience was quite unusual. When the weather is nice[r], you should expect more people. And the later you go, the longer the lines. I could only guess what would&rsquo;ve been our experience if we did the same on a weekend or a Chinese holiday.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/063_hu759a070c171c079bd73773e7ab6618cc_7528063_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/063_hu759a070c171c079bd73773e7ab6618cc_7528063_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In a rush or no, it&rsquo;s better to have a plan about what to do once you up there.</p>

<p>There are a lot of steep ascents and descents, and most of the surfaces are uneven. Going back and forth between watchtowers could be quite exhausting.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/064_hub9358e8647861c6809e1f53ca9811c26_9401538_0x1500_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/064_hub9358e8647861c6809e1f53ca9811c26_9401538_0x800_resize_q75_box.jpg#left" alt="" />

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://mntviews.blogspot.com/2018/09/great-wall-of-china-at-mutianyu-china.html">Paul Ma and his blog</a>, we had a precise idea of what we want to do when we will reach the top and planned our time with 5-minute precision.</p>

<p>Funny enough, we could not follow our plan at all.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/066_huede63895a5476d739c6782be67962430_9141595_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/066_huede63895a5476d739c6782be67962430_9141595_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The main idea we had in mind is to take the cable car up to tower #14 and walk all the way to tower #6, where we would descend with chairlift or toboggan. Given that both were closed due to weather conditions, wherever we would go, we would have to come back to tower #14 for a ride down.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/067_hu853a7d77038da3ce9381ac6f7dad26b8_3469603_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/067_hu853a7d77038da3ce9381ac6f7dad26b8_3469603_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Another issue we faced - it was dangerously slippery. All the walkways are paved with stone which, when wet and covered in snow, is as slippery as ice. At this point, slippery stairs were the best surface you could hope for. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s just very steep and slick ascents and descents - 30° if not more.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/068_hu952d2cad15ad3781a071da4f601f6af7_3525939_0x1500_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/068_hu952d2cad15ad3781a071da4f601f6af7_3525939_0x800_resize_q75_box.jpg#left" alt="" />

<p>Even in such conditions, one could slowly walk around and reach anywhere, but the only thing we didn&rsquo;t have was time. We gave up on our backup plan to walk to tower #23 and spent 40 minutes between towers #13 and #15.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/070_hu83007a90fdc723aba2d95eb7c8333015_5168271_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/070_hu83007a90fdc723aba2d95eb7c8333015_5168271_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As time passed, more and more people were showing up on the wall. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was crowded, or we had trouble taking a photo without anyone in it, but you could easily tell the difference.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/071_hua80c89d65d96fd7c0f56753887abf3c4_2830281_0x1500_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/071_hua80c89d65d96fd7c0f56753887abf3c4_2830281_0x800_resize_q75_box.jpg#left" alt="" /></p>

<p>Worried about potential travel delays on the way to the airport, we decided to wrap up sooner than initially planned and went back to the cable car station.</p>

<p>By 08:55, we were in a cabin on the way down.</p>

<p>For what it worth, we didn&rsquo;t risk leaving our luggage anywhere, and I spent all the time on the wall with a backpack. Couldn&rsquo;t say it bothered me at all. If anything, it made me feel warmer.</p>

<p>It was pretty cold, and the clothes we packed weren&rsquo;t good enough. Although, on top of the wall, it was warmer than at the bottom.</p>

<p>The descent was even more dramatic than the ascent as snowfall wasn&rsquo;t getting any weaker.</p>

<p>09:00, we&rsquo;re at the lower station and walking back to the shuttle bus stop.</p>

<figure>
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/350612565" width="960" height="540" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
</figure>

<p>We reached the bus stop by 09:10 and neither there was a shuttle nor anyone else besides 2 people from the staff.</p>

<p>Our biggest disappointment was that we had to wait for about 20 minutes for the bus to arrive. It wasn&rsquo;t the downpour or the near-freezing temperature that bothered us but the fact that we could&rsquo;ve spent those 20 minutes up on the wall and walked to one or few more watchtowers.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/090_hu372641b1e051ad08a15305dbe2060269_9114090_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/090_hu372641b1e051ad08a15305dbe2060269_9114090_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The only relief was the spectacular view around.</p>

<p>By 09:50, we returned to the parking where our driver was patiently waiting.</p>

<p>By 10:50, we walked into the 3rd terminal of <em>Beijing Capital Airport</em>.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/100_huafa8cd9bc7c445a059472628967af0a9_12047382_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/100_huafa8cd9bc7c445a059472628967af0a9_12047382_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Around that time, there are <strong>a lot</strong> of people at the airport, but it didn&rsquo;t feel overcrowded. It took us about 30 minutes, if not less, to go through all the checks. We reached our gate 90 minutes before scheduled departure time and had plenty of time for a proper breakfast.</p>

<p><img data-zoom-target="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/110_hu23d8be10cb074e6bcc5610a45c5c82bd_2726921_0x1500_resize_q75_box.jpg" src="/posts/2019/04/09/mutianyu-great-wall/images/110_hu23d8be10cb074e6bcc5610a45c5c82bd_2726921_0x800_resize_q75_box.jpg#right" alt="" /></p>

<p>All in all, it was a very rapid endeavor that took some effort to organize and execute. Nevertheless, we liked every second of it.</p>

<p>The total cost was about 200 USD - that&rsquo;s the taxi and the admission.</p>

<p>We left <em>Beijing</em> around 6:00 and were standing on top of <em>Mutianyu</em> wall in just 2 hours. With only about 40 minutes up there, we reached our plane&rsquo;s gate in another 2 hours since we turned back. In the same circumstances, we could&rsquo;ve spent 2 hours on the wall if we would&rsquo;ve researched the shuttle bus schedule better and planned to arrive at the airport 30 minutes later.</p>

<p>If you have a similar stopover and considering whether to do it - just do it!</p>
