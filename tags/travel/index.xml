      <description>TL;DR: We had an 18-hour-long stopover in Bejing early April and went to see Mutianyu section of the Great Wall of China. Weather was crazy. We had a fantastic experience.
 On our way back from Japan, we had yet another stopover in Beijing as we flew with Air China. Arriving late in the evening, our flight out was in the early afternoon of the next day. We would be on a tight schedule, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss this opportunity.</description>

      <description>Back in December of 2018, we&amp;rsquo;ve been planning a trip to Japan and were looking for ways to save on airfare. The cheapest option we found was to fly with Air China and included an overnight layover in Beijing.
Our friends1, who flew with some other Chinese airlines, told us they got free accommodation whenever they had a stopover. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t find such an option on our reservation, but even counting the price of 2 extra nights, it was the cheapest alternative.</description>

      <title>Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Zone of Alienation</title>

      <description>About 10 years ago I had a chance to visit Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Zone of Alienation. In fact, nowadays anybody can legally visit it one way or another. It is relatively safe out there and most of the territory is unrestricted - for instance, there are people living in the town of Chernobyl. But certain parts of The Zone are off limits.
Among places that are off limits is the ghost town of Pripyat - in order to enter it you need a special authorization.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve had planned a trip to South Florida for early October 2016 but had to cancel the very last moment as hurricane Mathew hit on the exact date of our flight. As much as we were sad that we had to cancel, as much I&amp;rsquo;m happy now that we had to do so. And there is a sole reason for that: while re-working our trip plan, we learned about Dry Tortugas National Park and had a chance to include it in our itinerary.</description>
