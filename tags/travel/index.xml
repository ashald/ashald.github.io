      <description>TL;DR: We had an 18-hour-long stopover in Bejing early April and went to see Mutianyu section of the Great Wall of China. Weather was crazy. We had a fantastic experience.
 Back in December of 2018, we&amp;rsquo;ve been planning a trip to Japan and were looking for ways to save on airfare. The cheapest option we discovered was with Air China and included an overnight layover. Our friends who flew with some other Chinese airlines told us they got free accommodation whenever they had a stopover.</description>

      <description>About 10 years ago I had a chance to visit Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Zone of Alienation. In fact, nowadays anybody can legally visit it one way or another. It is relatively safe out there and most of the territory is unrestricted - for instance, there are people living in the town of Chernobyl. But certain parts of The Zone are off limits.
Among places that are off limits is the ghost town of _Pripyat_ - in order to enter it you need a special authorization.</description>
