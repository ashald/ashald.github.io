      <description>Just a few months ago I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about Yayoi Kusama. And even if I heard her name, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay attention. As much as I enjoy modern art, I&amp;rsquo;ve got to appreciate it just recently and to the big surprise of surrounding people I miss a lot of common knowledge about it.
Back in November I and Irena were in Japan, hunting for Momiji. On the night before going back we were hanging out with Andrew around Shinjuku, Tokyo and at some point, he mentioned that nearby there is a psychiatric hospital where one of his favorite artists dwells.</description>

      <description>Although I&amp;rsquo;ve been living around Dupont Circle for about a year by now, I learned about Dupont Underground just recently and absolutely accidentally.
Built around 70 years ago, it&amp;rsquo;s a set of underground tunnels and passages below Dupont Traffic Circle in Washington, DC. At that time there were streetcars (that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;trams&amp;rdquo; outside of US) in the District and since Dupont Circle was already quite busy with cars, somebody came up with an idea to put streetcars underground, so they don&amp;rsquo;t get in the way of regular vehicles.</description>
